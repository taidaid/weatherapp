This project was created as a demo for Clockwork using Create-React-App, Dark-Sky-API, Opencage-API-Client, React-Chartjs-2, and React-Smooth-Collapse.
The app can use your browser's Navigator API to get the gelocation of your device.
It can also accept input latitude/longitude coordinates to get that local forecast.
Or you can enter a place name to get a forecast.

To build the app locally, run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Then open [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
